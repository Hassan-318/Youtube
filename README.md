## **Youtube Homepage**
Welcome to the README for the YouTube Homepage project! This project is a static webpage that replicates the appearance and layout of the YouTube homepage using only HTML and CSS. Below, you'll find information on how to set up, explore the features, and contribute to this project.
**Features**
The YouTube Webpage project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to create a simplified version of the YouTube homepage. It includes the following features:

**Navigation Bar:** The top of the webpage features a navigation bar with the YouTube logo, search bar, and icons for notifications, user profiles, and menus. Also, the usage of position-fixed means its location is determined based on the viewport, rather than its position within the document flow. This allows it to stay in the same place relative to the viewport, regardless of scrolling.

**Video Thumbnails:** Multiple video thumbnails are displayed in a grid layout, showcasing the use of CSS for layout and image styling.

**Video Information:** Each video thumbnail includes details like the video title, channel name, view count, and upload date.

**Search Bar:** The search bar demonstrates HTML form elements and CSS styling for input fields and buttons.

**Recommended Videos:** A section with recommended videos is displayed, highlighting additional video thumbnails and their details.

**Responsive Design:** The webpage is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and content to different screen sizes.

**CSS Styling:** CSS is extensively used for styling elements, including fonts, colors, margins, and padding.
